# Welcome

Welcome to a *very unstable* small project!

## What is this?

It's Discord.js Bot framework.

## Q&A

### Should I use this?

**Really nope.**

This project is really unstable and incomplete.

In meanwhile, I recommend use [Klasa](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa) framework.

## In ending

__**Use at own risk, please.**__
