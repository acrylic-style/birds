# Welcome

Welcome to a *very unstable* small project!

## Warning

**I won't provide any supports right now, in mean while, check out [bot-framework](https://github.com/acrylic-style/bot-framework)!**

~~It's not really framework but it might helps your bot!~~

## What is this?

It's Discord.js Bot framework.

## Q&A

### Should I use this?

**Really nope.**

This project is really unstable and incomplete.

In meanwhile, I recommend use [Klasa](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa) framework.

## In ending

__**Use at own risk for now.**__

If you want a new feature, please send pull request.
